# DSA with C++

This repository contains my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** practice and implementations using **C++**.  
The goal of this repo is **learning, revision, and consistent problem-solving**, not showing off fancy frameworks.

All concepts and problem approaches are primarily learned from the following YouTube playlist:

## 🛠 Language & Tools

- **Language:** C++
- **Compiler:** GCC / Clang
- **IDE:** VS Code

---

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repo

- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Prepare for **coding interviews**
- Create a personal **revision reference**
- Track learning progress publicly

This is a **learning repo**, so:
- Code may be optimized later
- Multiple approaches may exist for the same problem
- Comments focus on *logic*, not spoon-feeding

---

## 🤝 Credits

- **Apna College (Aman Dhattarwal)** for the structured DSA playlist  
- Problems inspired by common interview and competitive programming patterns

---

## 📈 Progress Status

🚧 **Ongoing** — updated regularly as I complete topics.

---

## ⭐ How to Use This Repo

- Clone the repository
- Navigate topic folders
- Compile and run `.cpp` files
- Modify, break, and rebuild the logic (that’s how you actually learn)

---

## ⚠️ Disclaimer

If you just read code without implementing it yourself, **you’re wasting your time**.  
Use this repo as a **reference**, not a crutch.
